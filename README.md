* **About the Project**
  - Its [Instacart Kaggle Challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis) coming from <b>Instacart</b>, with the big plan on creating a delightful shopping experience. With the transactional data provided, we can perform <b><u>RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetory)</u></b>, <b><u>Market Basket Analysis</u></b>, <b><u>Association Rule</u></b>, <b><u>Customer Segmentation (unsupervised learning)</u></b> and <b><u>Prediction of Next Product on User will Buy</u></b>. With this transaction data with <font color='blue'>3 Million Instacart Orders</font>, let kick started on it!
  
* **Getting Started**
  - Would like to run the tutorial material on servers hosted elsewhere, to avoid installation,
  - Prefer to use the `conda` package manager (which ships with the Anaconda distribution of Python),
  - Prefer to use `pipenv`, which is a package authored by Kenneth Reitz for package management with `pip` and `virtualenv`, or
  - Only want to view the website version of the notebooks.
